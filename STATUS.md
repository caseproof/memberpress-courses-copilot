- **Root Cause**: Field mapping mismatch between frontend 'role' and backend 'type'
- **Fix Applied**:
  - Added proper field mapping in SimpleAjaxController::handleSaveConversation()
  - Fixed CourseAjaxService::loadConversation() to map fields correctly
  - Enhanced debug logging for troubleshooting

### Published Course Protection (08/26/2025)

## Architecture Overview

### Key Components

1. **LLMService** - Handles all AI communication via auth gateway
2. **ConversationManager** - THE ONLY session handler (replaced SessionService)
3. **CourseGeneratorService** - Creates courses, sections, and lessons in MemberPress
4. **CourseIntegrationService** - Manages UI integration and AJAX endpoints
5. **SimpleAjaxController** - Handles session management AJAX endpoints
6. **CourseAjaxService** - Handles AI-specific AJAX endpoints
7. **Logger** - Comprehensive logging system for debugging

### Data Flow

1. User interacts with AI chat interface
2. AI generates course structure JSON
3. Course data is validated and passed to CourseGeneratorService
4. Generator creates hierarchical structure:
   - Course (mpcs-course post type)
   - Sections (stored in wp_mpcs_sections table)
   - Lessons (mpcs-lesson post type)

### MemberPress Integration

- Uses official MemberPress model classes (Course, Section, Lesson)
- Follows MemberPress data structures and conventions
- Sections stored in custom table with UUIDs
- Proper parent-child relationships maintained
