The MemberPress Courses Copilot plugin is now fully functional with AI-powered course creation capabilities. All major architecture improvements and bug fixes have been completed.

## Recent Critical Fixes

  - Deleted 464 lines of legacy code
  - Migrated all session handling to ConversationManager
  - Simplified architecture following KISS principles
  
### Message History Persistence Fix (08/26/2025)

- **Root Cause**: Field mapping mismatch between frontend 'role' and backend 'type'
- **Fix Applied**:
  - Added proper field mapping in SimpleAjaxController::handleSaveConversation()
  - Fixed CourseAjaxService::loadConversation() to map fields correctly
  - Enhanced debug logging for troubleshooting

### Published Course Protection (08/26/2025)

- **Fix Applied**:
  - Disabled chat interface for published courses
  - Added visual indicators and helpful messaging
  - Users must use "Duplicate Course" for edits

  - `/assets/js/course-editor-page.js`
  - `/assets/css/course-editor-page.css`

### MemberPress Courses Curriculum Creation (08/21/2025)
- **Issue**: Sections and lessons weren't appearing in the Curriculum tab after course creation
- **Root Cause**: Sections were being created as WordPress posts instead of using the MemberPress custom database table
- **Fix Applied**: 
  - Updated `CourseGeneratorService` to use MemberPress Section model
  - Sections now properly stored in `wp_mpcs_sections` table with required UUIDs
  - Fixed lesson parent relationships (course as parent, section ID as metadata)
  - Added comprehensive logging throughout the creation process
- **Files Modified**:
  - `/src/MemberPressCoursesCopilot/Services/CourseGeneratorService.php`
  - `/src/MemberPressCoursesCopilot/Services/CourseIntegrationService.php`
  - `/assets/js/ai-copilot.js`

### Conversation Persistence & UI (08/21/2025)
- Fixed conversation persistence across page refreshes
- Improved AI response visibility with proper CSS styling
- Fixed course preview loading from saved conversations
- Enhanced chat interface layout with proper flexbox implementation
- Moved conversation management buttons below chat area

## Architecture Overview

### Key Components

1. **LLMService** - Handles all AI communication via auth gateway
2. **ConversationManager** - THE ONLY session handler (replaced SessionService)
3. **CourseGeneratorService** - Creates courses, sections, and lessons in MemberPress
4. **CourseIntegrationService** - Manages UI integration and AJAX endpoints
5. **SimpleAjaxController** - Handles session management AJAX endpoints
6. **CourseAjaxService** - Handles AI-specific AJAX endpoints
7. **Logger** - Comprehensive logging system for debugging

### Data Flow

1. User interacts with AI chat interface
2. AI generates course structure JSON
3. Course data is validated and passed to CourseGeneratorService
4. Generator creates hierarchical structure:
   - Course (mpcs-course post type)
   - Sections (stored in wp_mpcs_sections table)
   - Lessons (mpcs-lesson post type)

### MemberPress Integration

- Uses official MemberPress model classes (Course, Section, Lesson)
- Follows MemberPress data structures and conventions
- Sections stored in custom table with UUIDs
- Proper parent-child relationships maintained

## Testing Checklist

- [ ] Create course with AI generates proper structure
- [ ] Sections appear in Curriculum tab with correct order
- [ ] Lessons nested under appropriate sections
- [ ] Course preview updates during conversation
- [ ] Conversations persist across page refreshes

2. Implement course templates system
3. Add collaborative editing features
4. Enhance AI prompts for better course generation
5. Add analytics and usage tracking
