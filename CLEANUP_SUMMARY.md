# MemberPress Courses Copilot - Final Cleanup Summary

## Date: 2025-08-26

### Changes Made During Final Cleanup

#### 1. Removed Global Variable
- **File**: `src/MemberPressCoursesCopilot/Plugin.php`
- **Change**: Removed the global variable `$mpcc_llm_service` and its initialization
- **Reason**: Global variables are an anti-pattern. Services are properly instantiated where needed through dependency injection

#### 2. TODOs and FIXMEs Status
- **Found**: 2 occurrences
  - `CourseAjaxService.php:203` - TODO comment in fallback JavaScript code
  - `CourseAjaxService.php:750` - The word "todo" appears in a user prompt example
- **Action**: No action needed. The TODO is in fallback code that's not used when proper templates are available, and the second occurrence is just example text

#### 3. Verification Results
- **Autoloading**: PSR-4 autoloading is properly configured
- **NonceConstants**: Used correctly in `SessionFeaturesService`
- **SimpleAjaxController**: Exists and is properly initialized
- **LLMService**: Instantiated properly in all required locations:
  - ContentGenerationService
  - CourseAjaxService (multiple locations)
  - SimpleAjaxController
  - Unit tests

#### 4. Dependencies Check
All critical dependencies are properly loaded:
- AJAX handlers have proper service instantiation
- Security classes (NonceConstants) are available where needed
- No broken dependencies found

### Overall Code Health
- ✅ No global variables
- ✅ Proper dependency injection pattern used
- ✅ Services instantiated where needed
- ✅ Autoloading configured correctly
- ✅ No critical TODOs requiring immediate attention

### Recommendations
1. The TODO in the fallback JavaScript could be removed or updated to reflect that the actual implementation exists in the proper AJAX endpoints
2. Consider removing the fallback chat interface entirely if the template system is always available
3. All changes maintain backward compatibility and don't break existing functionality
