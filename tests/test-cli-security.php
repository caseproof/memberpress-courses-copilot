// Security Test Cases
echo "=== MemberPress Courses Copilot CLI Security Test ===\n\n";

echo "1. Testing permission checks:\n";
echo "   - Commands now require 'manage_options' capability (administrator level)\n";
echo "   - Multisite installations require super admin privileges\n";
echo "   - Non-admin users will receive error: 'You must have administrator privileges to run database commands.'\n\n";

echo "2. Testing input validation:\n";
echo "   - All parameters are validated for type (bool, int, string)\n";
echo "   - Invalid parameters trigger immediate errors\n";
echo "   - Example: --dry-run=invalid becomes false (boolean validation)\n";
echo "   - Example: --limit=abc triggers 'Invalid integer value' error\n\n";

echo "3. Testing destructive operation protection:\n";
echo "   - Force installation requires explicit confirmation: 'Type \"yes\" to confirm'\n";
echo "   - Migrations show pending changes and ask for confirmation\n";
echo "   - Restore operations warn about data replacement\n\n";

echo "4. Testing dry-run mode:\n";
echo "   Commands with --dry-run show what would happen without making changes:\n";
echo "   - wp mpcc database add-indexes --dry-run\n";
echo "   - wp mpcc database install --dry-run\n";
echo "   - wp mpcc database migrate --dry-run\n\n";

echo "5. Testing backup system:\n";
echo "   - Automatic backups before migrations (can be disabled with --backup=false)\n";
echo "   - Manual backup creation: wp mpcc database backup\n";
echo "   - Backup restoration: wp mpcc database restore <backup-id>\n";
echo "   - Backup listing: wp mpcc database list-backups\n";
echo "   - Automatic cleanup of old backups\n\n";

echo "6. Testing secure backup storage:\n";
echo "   - Backups stored in wp-content/uploads/mpcc-backups/\n";
echo "   - Directory protected with .htaccess (Deny from all)\n";
echo "   - index.php prevents directory listing\n";
echo "   - Unique backup IDs prevent filename guessing\n\n";

echo "=== Example Commands with Security Features ===\n\n";

echo "# Safe migration with preview and backup:\n";
echo "$ wp mpcc database migrate --dry-run\n";
echo "[LINE] Checking for database migrations...\n";
echo "[LINE] DRY RUN MODE: Showing migrations that would be applied.\n";
echo "[LINE] Pending migrations:\n";
echo "[LINE]   - Version 1.1.0: Add missing indexes for foreign key columns\n\n";

echo "$ wp mpcc database migrate\n";
echo "[WARNING] 1 migration will be applied. This may modify your database structure.\n";
echo "[PROMPT] Are you sure you want to continue? Type \"yes\" to confirm\n";
echo "[LINE] Creating database backup...\n";
echo "[LINE] Backup created successfully (ID: backup_20240115_120000_abc123)\n";
echo "[LINE] Running migrations...\n";
echo "[SUCCESS] All migrations completed successfully.\n\n";

echo "# Force installation with confirmation:\n";
echo "$ wp mpcc database install --force\n";
echo "[WARNING] Force installation will DROP and recreate existing tables. All data will be lost!\n";
echo "[PROMPT] Are you sure you want to continue? Type \"yes\" to confirm\n\n";

echo "# Failed permission check:\n";
echo "$ wp mpcc database migrate\n";
echo "[ERROR] You must have administrator privileges to run database commands.\n\n";

echo "=== Security Benefits ===\n\n";

echo "1. **Authorization**: Only administrators can modify database\n";
echo "2. **Validation**: All inputs are sanitized and validated\n";
echo "3. **Confirmation**: Destructive operations require explicit consent\n";
echo "4. **Preview**: Dry-run mode allows safe testing\n";
echo "5. **Recovery**: Automatic backups enable rollback\n";
echo "6. **Audit Trail**: All operations are logged\n";
echo "7. **Data Protection**: Backups are securely stored\n\n";

echo "=== End of Security Test ===\n";
