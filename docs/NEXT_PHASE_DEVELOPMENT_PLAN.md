3. ~~**Code Organization**: CourseIntegrationService violates SRP (1000+ lines)~~ âœ… COMPLETED - split into 3 services
4. **Technical Debt**: Mixed HTML/JS/CSS in PHP heredocs (partially addressed)

## Phase 4: Production Readiness (2 weeks)

### Week 1: Critical Fixes & Refactoring

#### Day 1-2: ~~Security & Configuration~~ âœ… COMPLETED
- [x] Remove hardcoded API key from LLMService.php
- [x] Implement secure key storage via auth gateway
- [x] Auth gateway validates license keys
- [x] Master API key stored securely on gateway server
- [x] Documentation created for setup and deployment

#### Day 3-4: Code Refactoring âœ… 90% COMPLETE
- [x] `CourseUIService` - Handle UI rendering âœ… CREATED
- [x] `CourseAjaxService` - Handle AJAX endpoints âœ… CREATED (08/22/2025)
- [x] `CourseAssetService` - Handle CSS/JS enqueueing âœ… CREATED (08/22/2025)

- [x] Move inline CSS to dedicated stylesheets âœ… 100% DONE
- [x] Move inline JavaScript to separate files âœ… 90% DONE

*Note: CourseIntegrationService successfully reduced from 1373 to 321 lines! Now handles only UI integration.*

**Refactoring Completed (08/22/2025):**
1. ~~**Service Splitting**: Break CourseIntegrationService into CourseAjaxService (AJAX handlers) and CourseAssetService (CSS/JS)~~ âœ… COMPLETE
2. **Preserved All Functionality**: No styling or feature changes during refactoring

2. **Extract Utilities**: Create shared modules for notifications, AJAX helpers, and message formatting
3. **Remove YAGNI Violations**: Strip unused features (voice recording, drag-drop, themes) from ai-copilot.js
4. **Fix Event Handler Conflicts**: Consolidate multiple handlers for same actions (send button, quick start)
5. **Inline Code Removal**: Extract remaining inline styles/scripts from PHP files

#### Day 5: State Persistence âœ… COMPLETE
- [x] Implement conversation state persistence in database âœ…
- [x] Add conversation_sessions table âœ… (as mpcc_conversations)
- [x] Create session recovery mechanism âœ…
