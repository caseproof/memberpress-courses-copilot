### üî¥ Critical Issues Requiring Immediate Attention
1. ~~**Security**: Hardcoded API key in LLMService.php must be removed~~ ‚úÖ COMPLETED via Auth Gateway
2. ~~**State Management**: Conversations lost on page refresh~~ ‚úÖ COMPLETED with session persistence
3. **Code Organization**: CourseIntegrationService violates SRP (1000+ lines)
4. **Technical Debt**: Mixed HTML/JS/CSS in PHP heredocs

## Phase 4: Production Readiness (2 weeks)

### Week 1: Critical Fixes & Refactoring

#### Day 1-2: ~~Security & Configuration~~ ‚úÖ COMPLETED
- [x] Remove hardcoded API key from LLMService.php
- [x] Implement secure key storage via auth gateway
- [x] Auth gateway validates license keys
- [x] Master API key stored securely on gateway server
- [x] Documentation created for setup and deployment

#### Day 3-4: Code Refactoring ‚úÖ 40% COMPLETE (PARTIALLY DONE)
- [x] `CourseUIService` - Handle UI rendering ‚úÖ CREATED
- [ ] `CourseAjaxService` - Handle AJAX endpoints ‚ùå NOT CREATED
- [ ] `CourseAssetService` - Handle CSS/JS enqueueing ‚ùå NOT CREATED
- [x] Extract HTML templates to separate template files ‚úÖ 80% DONE
- [x] Move inline CSS to dedicated stylesheets ‚úÖ 100% DONE
- [x] Move inline JavaScript to separate files ‚úÖ 90% DONE

*Note: CourseIntegrationService still 1279 lines, needs splitting into smaller services*

**Refactoring Priorities Identified:**
1. **JavaScript Consolidation**: Merge ai-copilot.js functionality into simple-ai-chat.js to eliminate duplicate event handlers
2. **Service Splitting**: Break CourseIntegrationService into CourseAjaxService (AJAX handlers) and CourseAssetService (CSS/JS)
3. **Extract Utilities**: Create shared modules for notifications, AJAX helpers, and message formatting
4. **Remove YAGNI Violations**: Strip unused features (voice recording, drag-drop, themes) from ai-copilot.js
5. **Fix Event Handler Conflicts**: Consolidate multiple handlers for same actions (send button, quick start)
6. **Inline Code Removal**: Extract remaining inline styles/scripts from PHP files

#### Day 5: State Persistence ‚úÖ COMPLETE
- [x] Implement conversation state persistence in database ‚úÖ
- [x] Add conversation_sessions table ‚úÖ (as mpcc_conversations)
- [x] Create session recovery mechanism ‚úÖ
- [x] Add auto-save functionality ‚úÖ (30-second intervals)
- [x] Implement session expiration ‚úÖ (1 hour cleanup)

### Additional Work Completed (Beyond Original Plan)
