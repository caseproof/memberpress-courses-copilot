# Quiz Integration UX Improvement: Auto-Detection of Lesson Context

## Overview
This document describes the implementation of UX improvement #14, which enhances the quiz creation experience by automatically detecting and pre-selecting the associated lesson when creating quizzes.

## Problem Statement
Previously, when creating a quiz, users had to manually select the lesson from a dropdown, even when the quiz creation was initiated from a specific lesson context. This added unnecessary friction to the workflow.

## Solution
Implemented comprehensive auto-detection of lesson context using multiple detection methods with fallback strategies.

## Detection Methods

### 1. URL Parameter Detection
- **Priority**: Highest
- **Parameters checked**: `lesson_id`, `lesson`, `from_lesson`
- **Use case**: When quiz is created via a link with lesson context

### 2. Referrer Detection
- **Priority**: High
- **Method**: Checks if coming from a lesson edit page
- **Validation**: Verifies the post type to ensure it's a lesson

### 3. Form Field Detection
- **Priority**: Medium
- **Fields checked**: `_mpcs_lesson_id`, `lesson_id`, `#lesson_id`, `.lesson-selector`
- **Use case**: When quiz already has lesson selector in form

### 4. Post Meta Detection
- **Priority**: Medium
- **Fields checked**: `_lesson_id`, `mpcs_lesson_id`
- **Use case**: Alternative meta field names

### 5. Existing Quiz Meta Detection
- **Priority**: Low
- **Method**: Checks if quiz already has associated lesson
- **Use case**: When editing existing quiz

### 6. Dynamic Form Monitoring
- **Priority**: Continuous
- **Method**: Monitors form changes every second
- **Use case**: When lesson is selected after modal opens

## Visual Feedback

### Auto-Detection Indicator
When a lesson is auto-detected, users see:
- Green checkmark icon
- Message indicating detection method
- Subtle highlight animation on the field

### Detection Messages
- "Auto-detected from URL"
- "Auto-detected from previous page"
- "Auto-detected from quiz form"
- "Auto-detected from quiz settings"
- "Previously selected lesson"
- "Updated from quiz form"

## Additional Features

### Create Quiz from Lesson
Added "Create Quiz" button to lesson editor that:
- Creates a new quiz with lesson pre-associated
- Names quiz as "Quiz: [Lesson Title]"
- Redirects to quiz editor with lesson context preserved

### Files Modified

1. **quiz-ai-modal.js**
   - Enhanced `detectLessonContext()` method
   - Added `showAutoDetectionFeedback()` method
   - Added `startLessonMonitoring()` for dynamic updates

2. **quiz-ai-modal.css**
   - Added `.mpcc-auto-detected` styles
   - Added highlight animation

3. **lesson-quiz-integration.js** (new)
   - Adds "Create Quiz" button to lesson editor
   - Handles quiz creation from lesson context

4. **MpccQuizAjaxController.php**
   - Added `create_quiz_from_lesson()` method
   - Handles AJAX request for quiz creation

5. **AssetManager.php**
   - Registered new script
   - Added lesson editor asset enqueuing
   - Added script localizations

## User Benefits

1. **Reduced Clicks**: No need to manually select lesson when context is available
2. **Clear Feedback**: Users know when and how lesson was detected
3. **Seamless Workflow**: Natural progression from lesson to quiz creation
4. **Error Prevention**: Reduces chance of selecting wrong lesson

## Technical Implementation

### JavaScript Detection Logic
```javascript
detectLessonContext() {
    // Check multiple sources in priority order
    // Store detection method for feedback
    // Log all detection attempts
}
```

### CSS Visual Indicators
```css
.mpcc-auto-detected {
    /* Green success styling */
    /* Fade-in animation */
}

.mpcc-highlight {
    /* Temporary highlight animation */
}
```

## Testing Scenarios

1. **URL Parameter**: Create quiz with `?lesson_id=123`
2. **From Lesson**: Click "Create Quiz" from lesson editor
3. **Referrer**: Navigate from lesson edit to quiz creation
4. **Form Update**: Change lesson in quiz form while modal is open
5. **No Context**: Create quiz without any lesson context

## Future Enhancements

1. Remember last selected lesson per user
2. Auto-detect course context as well
3. Bulk quiz creation from multiple lessons
4. Smart lesson suggestions based on content similarity
