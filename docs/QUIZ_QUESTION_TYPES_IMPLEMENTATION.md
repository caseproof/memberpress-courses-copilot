## Backend Implementation

### MpccQuizAIService Updates
1. **Content Validation**
   - Checks if lesson content is suitable for requested type
   - Returns helpful error messages if not suitable
   - Minimum content requirements per type

2. **Type-Specific Generation Methods**
   - `generateTrueFalseQuestions()`
   - `generateTextAnswerQuestions()`
   - `generateMultipleSelectQuestions()`

3. **AI Prompts**
   - Custom prompts for each question type
   - Clear instructions for formatting
   - Examples provided to AI

### Response Formats

**True/False:**
```json
{
  "statement": "The Earth revolves around the Sun",
  "correctAnswer": true,
  "explanation": "The Earth orbits the Sun once per year"
}
```

**Text Answer:**
```json
{
  "question": "What year did World War II end?",
  "correctAnswer": "1945",
  "acceptableAnswers": ["1945", "nineteen forty-five", "45"],
  "explanation": "World War II ended in 1945"
}
```

**Multiple Select:**
```json
{
  "question": "Which of the following are programming languages?",
  "options": ["Python", "HTML", "JavaScript", "CSS", "Ruby"],
  "correctAnswers": ["Python", "JavaScript", "Ruby"],
  "explanation": "Python, JavaScript, and Ruby are programming languages"
}
```

## Block Type Mapping

The frontend automatically selects the correct Gutenberg block:
- `memberpress-courses/multiple-choice-question`
- `memberpress-courses/true-false-question`
- `memberpress-courses/text-answer-question`
- `memberpress-courses/multiple-select-question`

## Validation Rules

### Controller Validation
- **Multiple Choice**: Requires options array and single correct answer
- **True/False**: Requires statement and boolean correct answer
- **Text Answer**: Requires correct answer, optional alternatives
- **Multiple Select**: Minimum 3 options, minimum 2 correct answers

## Error Handling

When content isn't suitable for a type:
- Clear error message explaining why
- Suggestions for alternative question types
- Tips for making content more suitable

Example: "This lesson doesn't contain enough specific facts for text-answer questions. Try multiple-choice instead, or add more factual content to your lesson."

## Version Update

Updated to version 1.0.8 for cache busting.
