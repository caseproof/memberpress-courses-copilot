# Build Configuration Status

## Issues Found and Fixed

### 1. Webpack Configuration Issues
- **Issue**: webpack.config.js referenced non-existent source files in `src/assets/js/` directory
- **Fix**: Updated webpack.config.js to have an empty entry configuration since the current JavaScript files are standalone and don't require bundling

### 2. Package.json Script Issues  
- **Issue**: npm scripts referenced non-existent `src/assets/scss/` directory for SASS compilation
- **Issue**: Build scripts attempted to run webpack when there's nothing to bundle
- **Fix**: Removed build/dev/watch scripts since no bundling is currently needed
- **Fix**: Updated lint paths to point to actual `assets/js/` and `assets/css/` directories

### 3. Project Structure Mismatch
- **Expected**: Source files in `src/assets/js/` and `src/assets/scss/`
- **Actual**: Files are directly in `assets/js/` and `assets/css/`
- **Resolution**: Configuration now matches actual project structure

## Current Configuration

### JavaScript Files
All JavaScript files in `assets/js/` are standalone WordPress plugin files that:
- Use jQuery and WordPress globals
- Don't use ES6 modules
- Are loaded directly by WordPress (not bundled)

### CSS Files  
CSS files in `assets/css/` are already compiled and ready to use.

### Available npm Scripts
- `npm run lint` - Run both CSS and JS linting
- `npm run lint:css` - Lint CSS files
- `npm run lint:js` - Lint JavaScript files  
- `npm run lint:fix` - Auto-fix linting issues
- `npm run format` - Format code with Prettier
- `npm test:ai-chat` - Run AI chat integration tests
- `npm run diagnostic` - Run diagnostic checks

## Future Development

If you need to use modern JavaScript modules or SASS in the future:
1. Create source directories: `src/js/` and `src/scss/`
2. Update webpack.config.js with appropriate entry points
3. Add back the build scripts to package.json
4. Run `npm run build` to compile assets

The webpack and build tooling is configured and ready, just not currently in use since the existing code doesn't require bundling.
