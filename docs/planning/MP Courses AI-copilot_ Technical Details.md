# MP Courses AI-copilot: Technical Details

## Project Overview

The MP Courses AI-copilot is an AI-powered conversational interface that integrates directly into the MemberPress Courses plugin. Users interact with the system through natural language to generate complete course structures, including sections, lessons, learning objectives, and content outlines. The system translates conversational inputs into WordPress course entities that integrate seamlessly with existing MemberPress functionality.

## Core Functionality

### Conversational Course Creation

The AI-copilot operates through a chat-based interface embedded in the WordPress admin area. Users describe their course concept, target audience, and learning goals through natural conversation. The system asks clarifying questions to gather necessary details and builds the course structure in real-time.

The conversation flow follows a structured pattern:

1. Initial course concept gathering  
2. Target audience identification  
3. Learning objective definition  
4. Content structure development  
5. Section and lesson organization  
6. Final review and generation

### Real-time Course Preview

As the conversation progresses, users see their course structure building in a preview panel. This provides immediate visual feedback and allows for adjustments before final generation. The preview shows the hierarchical structure of sections and lessons, learning objectives, and estimated content requirements.

### Automated Course Generation

Once the conversation is complete, the system automatically creates the WordPress course structure. This includes:

- Course post creation with metadata  
- Section organization and ordering  
- Lesson placeholder creation  
- Learning objective assignment  
- Content outline generation  
- Integration with MemberPress access controls

## Technical Architecture

### System Components

The AI-copilot consists of five primary technical components that work together to deliver the conversational course creation experience.

**AI Service Layer** This component manages all interactions with external AI providers through an abstraction layer that supports multiple AI services. The primary implementation uses OpenAI's GPT models, but the architecture allows for easy integration of additional providers like Anthropic Claude or Google Gemini. The service layer handles API authentication, request formatting, response processing, and error handling.

**Conversation Management System** The conversation engine maintains stateful dialogue between users and the AI. It implements a sophisticated state machine that tracks conversation progress, maintains context across multiple interactions, and handles conversation branching and error recovery. The system stores conversation history and can resume interrupted sessions.

**Course Factory** This component translates AI-generated course structures into WordPress entities. It creates course posts, establishes section hierarchies, generates lesson placeholders, and integrates with MemberPress data models. The factory ensures that generated courses comply with WordPress standards and MemberPress requirements.

**User Interface Layer** The frontend consists of a React-based chat interface integrated into the WordPress admin experience. It provides real-time messaging, typing indicators, quick-reply buttons, and the course structure preview panel. The interface maintains consistency with WordPress design patterns while providing modern conversational UX.

**Data Persistence Layer** This layer manages conversation storage, course templates, user preferences, and system analytics. It uses WordPress custom tables for conversation data and integrates with existing WordPress and MemberPress database structures for course information.

### Database Schema

The system requires two new database tables to support conversation management and template storage.

**Conversations Table (wp\_mpcs\_ai\_conversations)**

```sql
CREATE TABLE wp_mpcs_ai_conversations (
    id bigint(20) unsigned NOT NULL AUTO_INCREMENT,
    user_id bigint(20) unsigned NOT NULL,
    session_id varchar(255) NOT NULL,
    conversation_data longtext NOT NULL,
    status varchar(50) NOT NULL DEFAULT 'active',
    created_at datetime NOT NULL DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP,
    updated_at datetime NOT NULL DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP ON UPDATE CURRENT_TIMESTAMP,
    PRIMARY KEY (id),
    KEY user_id (user_id),
    KEY session_id (session_id),
    KEY status (status)
);
```

**Templates Table (wp\_mpcs\_ai\_templates)**

```sql
CREATE TABLE wp_mpcs_ai_templates (
    id bigint(20) unsigned NOT NULL AUTO_INCREMENT,
    name varchar(255) NOT NULL,
    description text,
    template_data longtext NOT NULL,
    category varchar(100),
    is_public tinyint(1) NOT NULL DEFAULT 0,
    created_by bigint(20) unsigned NOT NULL,
    created_at datetime NOT NULL DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP,
    updated_at datetime NOT NULL DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP ON UPDATE CURRENT_TIMESTAMP,
    PRIMARY KEY (id),
    KEY category (category),
    KEY is_public (is_public),
    KEY created_by (created_by)
);
```

### API Architecture

The system exposes REST API endpoints for frontend communication and potential third-party integrations.

**Conversation Endpoints**

- `POST /wp-json/memberpress-courses/v1/ai/conversation/start` \- Initialize new conversation  
- `POST /wp-json/memberpress-courses/v1/ai/conversation/message` \- Send message to AI  
- `GET /wp-json/memberpress-courses/v1/ai/conversation/{id}` \- Retrieve conversation history  
- `POST /wp-json/memberpress-courses/v1/ai/conversation/{id}/resume` \- Resume paused conversation

**Course Generation Endpoints**

- `POST /wp-json/memberpress-courses/v1/ai/generate-course` \- Generate course from conversation  
- `GET /wp-json/memberpress-courses/v1/ai/preview/{conversation_id}` \- Get course structure preview  
- `POST /wp-json/memberpress-courses/v1/ai/validate-structure` \- Validate course structure

**Template Endpoints**

- `GET /wp-json/memberpress-courses/v1/ai/templates` \- List available templates  
- `POST /wp-json/memberpress-courses/v1/ai/templates` \- Create new template  
- `GET /wp-json/memberpress-courses/v1/ai/templates/{id}` \- Get specific template

## Implementation Details

### AI Integration

The AI service layer implements a provider abstraction pattern that allows for multiple AI service integrations. The primary implementation uses OpenAI's GPT-4 model with specialized prompts for course creation.

**Prompt Engineering** The system uses carefully crafted prompts that guide the AI to ask relevant questions and generate structured course outlines. Prompts are templated and can be customized based on course type, target audience, and complexity level.

**Response Processing** AI responses are parsed and validated to ensure they contain the required course structure elements. The system extracts course titles, section names, lesson topics, learning objectives, and content suggestions from AI-generated text.

**Context Management** The conversation system maintains context across multiple interactions by storing conversation history and providing relevant context to the AI in each request. This ensures coherent and progressive course development.

### WordPress Integration

The AI-copilot integrates deeply with WordPress and MemberPress through established hooks and filters.

**Admin Interface Integration** The chat interface is added to the MemberPress Courses admin pages through WordPress admin hooks. It appears as a new tab or panel in the course creation workflow.

**Course Creation Integration** Generated courses are created using standard WordPress post creation functions and MemberPress course registration methods. This ensures compatibility with existing functionality and third-party plugins.

**User Capability Integration** The system respects WordPress user capabilities and MemberPress permissions. Only users with appropriate course creation permissions can access the AI-copilot functionality.

### Security Implementation

The system implements comprehensive security measures to protect user data and prevent unauthorized access.

**Authentication and Authorization** All API endpoints require WordPress authentication and verify user capabilities before processing requests. The system uses WordPress nonces for CSRF protection and validates user permissions for each action.

**Data Sanitization** All user inputs are sanitized using WordPress sanitization functions. AI responses are also sanitized before storage or display to prevent XSS attacks.

**API Rate Limiting** The system implements rate limiting to prevent abuse of AI services and protect against excessive API usage. Limits are configurable and can be adjusted based on user roles or subscription levels.

### Performance Optimization

The system includes several performance optimization strategies to ensure responsive user experience.

**Caching Strategy** Conversation data is cached in WordPress transients to reduce database queries. AI responses for common course types are cached to improve response times for similar requests.

**Asynchronous Processing** Course generation is handled asynchronously to prevent timeout issues with large course structures. Users receive immediate feedback while the system processes the course creation in the background.

**Database Optimization** Database queries are optimized with appropriate indexing and query structure. The system uses WordPress query optimization best practices and includes database query monitoring.

## Development Approach

### Modular Architecture

The system is designed with a modular architecture that allows for independent development and testing of components. Each major component (AI service, conversation management, course factory, UI, data persistence) can be developed and deployed separately.

### Plugin Structure

The AI-copilot is implemented as an extension to the existing MemberPress Courses plugin rather than a standalone plugin. This ensures tight integration and reduces compatibility issues.
