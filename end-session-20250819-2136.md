# Work Summary - Session 20250819-2136

## Issues Resolved

### 1. Fatal Error: Class "MemberPressCoursesCopilot\Plugin" not found
**Problem**: The plugin was throwing a fatal error because the PSR-4 autoloader configuration in `composer.json` was incorrect.

**Root Cause**: The composer.json file had:
```json
"MemberPressCoursesCopilot\\": "src/"
```
But the actual directory structure was:
```
src/MemberPressCoursesCopilot/Plugin.php
```

**Solution**: 
- Fixed the PSR-4 mapping to: `"MemberPressCoursesCopilot\\": "src/MemberPressCoursesCopilot/"`
- Regenerated the composer autoloader with `composer dump-autoload -o`
- Added autoloader file existence check in the main plugin file

## Code Changes

### Files Modified:
1. **composer.json**
   - Fixed PSR-4 autoloader path from `"src/"` to `"src/MemberPressCoursesCopilot/"`
   - Previously added WordPress coding standards dependencies

2. **memberpress-courses-copilot.php**
   - Added autoloader file existence check with user-friendly error message
   - Ensures composer dependencies are installed before plugin activation

3. **vendor/composer/** (regenerated)
   - All autoloader files updated with correct class mappings
   - Now properly recognizes all 39 plugin classes

## Git Actions
- Created branch: `fix/autoloader-path`
- Committed autoloader fix and file existence check
- Merged `fix/autoloader-path` into `master`

## Current Status
- Fatal error resolved - Plugin class can now be properly loaded
- Autoloader correctly maps all namespace classes
- Ready for testing once opcache is cleared or server restarted

## Pending Issues
1. **Duplicate messages when clicking quick start buttons** - This issue still needs to be addressed after verifying the plugin loads correctly
2. **AI chat functionality** - Need to verify it's working properly in the left panel after the fatal error is resolved

## Next Steps
1. Clear opcache or restart local development server
2. Verify plugin loads without errors
3. Test AI chat functionality in the left panel
4. Fix the duplicate message issue with quick start buttons
5. Continue following Caseproof WordPress coding standards

## Technical Notes
- The issue was discovered when running `composer dump-autoload -o` which showed all classes were being skipped due to incorrect PSR-4 path
- Test script confirmed the autoloader works correctly after the fix
- WordPress may cache the old autoloader, requiring opcache clear or restart
